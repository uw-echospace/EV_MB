# BATMO: Bat Acoustic Tracking and Meteorological Observations

## Goals
This project seeks to analyze meteorological data (temperature, precipitation, humidity, lunar phase, and wind speed) alongside bat calls recorded in Union Bay Natural Area in Seattle, WA, to investigate how bats interact with their environment in different weather. 

## Usage

Once this project is finished, batmo scipts should allow one to pull hourly weather data from local UW stations UW-UH (Univerity of Washington Horticulture Center, located in UBNA) and UW-A (the station above the University of Washington's Atmospheric and Space Science building), 
save the data into a .csv file, and run statistical analyses to compare bat calls data from Aditya Krishna's bat-detector-msds repository with local weather data to explore correlations between environmental conditions to bat behavior in UBNA.
